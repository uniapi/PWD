{
  "Task":
    "Develop a program which displays \"Hello, World\nGoodbye, World\n\". The program should get the string \"Hello, World\" from the shared library and \"Goodbye, World\" from the static one",
  "Requirements": [
    "Makefile - the file describing an assembly",
    "main.c - the main source program code",
    "hello.c - the library source code, returning \"Hello, World\"",
    "goodbye.c - the library source code, returning \"Goodbye, World\""
   ],
  "Assembly": [
    "make - runs { make all }",
    "make all - builds the program and all its dependencies",
    "make clean - removes everything generated by { make all }",
    "make libs - builds the libraries only"
  ],
  "Version": [
    "The working code should reside in the { hello branch }",
    "No less than two git commits and push to © GitHub",
    "It's necessary to create the shared and static branches for the libraries"
  ],
  "Tips": "By default the Unix® and Unix-like systems do not load dynamic libraries from the current directory. In order to load it properly you can set LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable. For this and for all subsequent tasks you should use The K&R Style"
