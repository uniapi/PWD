## Task
Implement the following: there should be three processes: **A**, **B** and **C** in the program. The process A is used for a continuous data user input (a number). The entered number should be transfered from the process A to the process B using the `PIPE` mechanism. The process B should square the number and transfer the result to the process C through the shared memory. The process C should have two threads: *C1* and *C2*; the thread C1 should get the data from the process B using the `Shared Memory` mechanism and the thread C2 should display an arbitrary message (e.g.: "I am alive\n") to the terminal once per second but when the thread C1 gets the data from the process B it should display the message "value = XXXXX", where XXXXX - the number gotten from the process B through the shared memory (The number exponentiation resulted from the process A). If the exponentiation result is "100" (the user entered the number 10) the program should send the signal `SIGUSR1` to the process B which, in this case, completes all the working processes (A, B, C) correctly

### Requirements
* `Makefile` - the file describing an assembly
* `File naming` - unrestricted

### Assembly
* `make` - runs *make all*
* `make all` - builds the project
* `make clean` - removes everything generated by *make*/*make all*

### Version
* The working code should reside in the **ipc branch**
* No less than four git commits and push to `© GitHub`

### Tips
* Get acquainted with the **POSIX® standard** part necessary for implementing the program. The code will be checked not only for the actual operability but also for the error analysis, the work speed and the comments clarity. Try to choose such an implementation which would be *fastest*, *self-explanatory* and *simple* with regard to the required architecture
